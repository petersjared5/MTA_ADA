## Overview
This interactive Tableau dashboard explores the accessibility of subway stations across New York City’s five boroughs. Using MTA station data, it visualizes which stations are ADA-compliant and highlights structural and geographic disparities in accessibility.

## Key Insights
- Only 30.43% of subway stations across NYC are ADA-accessible.
- Brooklyn has the lowest borough-wide compliance rate at just 23%.
- Station structure type plays a major role: Open Cut and Viaduct stations are the least accessible.
- An interactive map allows users to drill down by borough and station to explore individual accessibility data.
